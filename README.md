## Step-by-Step Guide to Copy the Repository

You have two options to get a local copy of the repository: cloning it via Git or downloading it directly as a ZIP file.

Clone the Repository (Recommended for Git Users)

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**
   - On MacOS or Linux: Open Terminal.
   - On Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**
   - Use the `cd` command to move to the folder where you'd like to place this repository.
   - Example: `cd path/to/your/directory`

3. **Clone the Repository**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sezermzgl/FDS-HW2.git
     ```
   - This will create a folder named `FDS-HW2` in your current directory, containing all the files from the repository.

4. **Navigate into the Repository Folder**
   - Move into the repository's directory by running:
     ```bash
     cd FDS-HW2-2024
     ```

5. **Confirm the Repository Files**
   - To check that everything copied correctly, list the files in the directory:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - On Windows, you can use `dir` instead of `ls`.
